        My Isha 🌷,<br><br>
      

        11:24 a.m. May 6. My entire world changed in a moment that seemed so straightforward on the clock. I *crushed* into you like a wave that has been aching to kiss the shore, not just because I fell in love with you that day. Since then, time has *danced* around you rather than simply passing. 💃<br><br>

        It feels like the universe gave me a cheat code to happiness, and it's just you. Every moment I spend with you feels like a secret I never want the world to know. Nothing sounds sweeter than your voice, so you've ruined every song for me. I love the way you laugh, the way you pout when you're acting angry, and the way your eyes hold oceans. 🎶<br><br>
            
      
        You’ve got this spell on me — I swear, my heart skips like it’s got stage fright every time you call my name. Even your silence feels like poetry I want to memorize.<br><br>
      
        You’re not just beautiful, Isha — you’re *mine*. My favorite thought, my softest place to land, my late-night muse, my morning reason. You’re the kind of girl people dream of… but I get to call you *baby*.  
        And oh, I’m never letting go — not even in another lifetime. 🥺❤️<br><br>
      
        I want forever with you — messy hair mornings, warm chai evenings, and midnight cuddles where I whisper “I love you” into your ear a hundred times just to make sure the stars know too. ⭐<br><br>
      
        Yours, stupid in love and completely ruined by you,<br>
        — Ayush 💌
